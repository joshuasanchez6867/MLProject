The vast amounts of customer data being generated allows us \n                    insights into what it is that attracts customers to certain products and services. As more data is gathered,\n                    opportunities to use this data are also expanded. One of the main ways of using this data is creating better \n                    performing marketing tools aimed at target audiences. In order to do this, companies need to know which audiences\n                    are attracted to their advertisements, and which audiences they donâ€™t need to waste resources on. Our research seeks\n                    to find machine learning models which can accurately predict the effectiveness of a marketing campaign based on \n                    customer data. We will seek to discover which attributes of customer data are most strongly correlated with what\n                    kind of products they will buy, and how these attributes relate to each other to predict customer habits. With \n                    the knowledge of what attributes of customer data make marketing campaigns successful, companies can use machine\n                    learning models like the ones we researched to better understand which customers they should be targeting for \n                    specific ad campaigns.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className = \"Bio\">\n                    In the past decade, the data we generate has vastly increased as we find new ways to collect data from everyday \n                    life. In particular, customer data is higher than ever before with the rise of social media and online shopping.\n                    Companies like Amazon and Facebook observe each interaction of their users and use this information to show\n                    their customers what they want to see. Such companies are already using customer data and machine learning\n                    to their advantage. On nearly every website that we visit, advertisements are generated specifically to\n                    peak our individual interest. Often it is machine learning algorithms that are trying to determine what\n                    kind of advertisement a user is going to be interested in and what advertisements will thus be shown as\n                    a user scrolls through different websites. Our research seeks to further understand how different customer\n                    attributes relate to their buying habits, and if that will lead to them accepting store promotions. \n                    Besides trying to find models that could predict what a customer would buy, we were also able to look\n                    at how we can predict how much a customer will buy.\n
